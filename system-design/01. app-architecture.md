## Day 1 - App Architectures

* Beyond framework - how to an app architecture `or` how to design a big system `or` by building an app in which key area need to look for better design... so for build an app, which architecture we will need to figure out!?!
* Which architecture we need to follow...? so
* What are the architectures options??? (client-server architectures)
  1) Monolithic
  2) 2-Tier
  3) N-Tier
  4) Modular Monolith
  5) Micro-service
  6) Event Driven
  7) Cloud Native
  8) Serverless
  9) Mixed Way / Hybrid / ETC...

<br/>

## 1. Monolithic

Monolithic architecture - refers to a software application design. <br/>
where all components are `tightly coupled` & integrated into a single, self-contained unit. <br/>
Imagine a large building constructed from a single piece of stone. <br/>
that's the essence of a monolithic architecture. <br/>

`Note:` its a **single tier architecture** <br/>

* Logical layer called - `tier`
  * User Interface - layer
  * Business Logic - layer
  * Data Interface - layer
  * Database - layer <br/> so these layer is called `tier`

To be honest we never do monolithic arch/code  directly. <br/>
Our code based goes into multiple layers/tiers... <br/>
So we don't follow the exact monolithic architecture <br/>

Ever app `1st start` its `journey` by monolithic architecture. <br/>
Window, Linux, Mac-OS are monolithic architecture based app. <br/>

* **Key Characteristics**
  * Single Codebase
  * Centralized Deployment
  * Shared Database
  * Tight Coupling **(module data communication)**

|No| Advantage        | Disadvantage            |
|--|------------------|-------------------------|
|1 | Simplicity       | Scalability             |
|2 | Maintainability  | Maintainability         |
|3 | Cost-effective   | Agility                 |
|4 | Performance      | Single point of failure |

`Agility:` Difficult to implement frequently small new features or updates without affecting the entire app. <br/>
**Small update loop not possible** in this monolithic architecture. Modularity approach is not present here. <br/>
Little update effect at whole app. So its become **single point of failure** <br/>

<br/><br/>

## 2. 2-Tier

A 2-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern, that divides the application into two distinct layers:

1. `(Client) Presentation Tier`: This layer handles the **user interface** & interacts with the user directly.
2. `(Server) Data Tier`: This layer handles the **business logic**, **data storage**, & **processing**.

So when you break your app into different layers, you are increasing complexity of the application... <br/>

|No| Advantage                          | Disadvantage                |
|--|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|1 | Improved scalability               | Increased complexity        |
|2 | Enhanced maintainability           | Additional network traffic  |
|3 | Increased security                 | Single point of failure     |
|4 | Flexibility in technology choices  | ... ... ...                 |
|5 | Simplified deployment              | ... ... ...                 |
|6 | Performance benefits               | ... ... ...                 |

<br/><br/>

## 3. 3-Tier || N-Tier

N-tier architecture, also known as multi-tier architecture, is a software architecture pattern <br/>
that separates the application into multiple layers, each with distinct responsibilities.

1. Presentation Tier
2. Business Logic Tier
3. Data Access Layer
4. Integration Tier (Optional)

|No| Advantage                          | Disadvantage                    |
|--|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|1 | Improved scalability               | Increased complexity            |
|2 | Enhanced maintainability           | Additional network traffic      |
|3 | Increased security                 | Increased Debugging Difficulty  |
|4 | Flexibility in technology choices  | ... ... ...                     |
|5 | Simplified deployment              | ... ... ...                     |

<br/><br/>

## 4. Modular Monolith **

A modular monolithic architecture is a software development approach <br/>
that combines the benefits of modular design with the simplicity of a monolithic architecture. <br/>
It aims to address some of the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures while still retaining their advantages. <br/>

* **Key Characteristics**
  * Single Codebase
  * Independent Modules
  * Loose Coupling **(module data communication)** ***(by public/private api || function call)***
  * Shared Resources

|No| Advantage                | Disadvantage              |
|--|--------------------------|---------------------------|
|1 | Improved maintainability | Potential coupling issues |
|2 | Increased `agility`      | Limited scalability       |
|3 | Enhanced testability     | Single point of failure   |
|4 | Reduced complexity       | ... ... ...               |
|5 | Cost-effective           | ... ... ...               |

* Its a flavor of Micro-services, so its very easy to move in Micro-services architecture from this architecture.

<br/><br/>

## 5. Micro-service

Microservice architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as </br>
a collection of `small`, `independent`, & `loosely coupled` services/application. </br>
Each service is **self-contained** & **focuses** on a **single business capability**. </br>
Services **communicate** with each other through <u>well-defined APIs</u> </br>
The more we increase the service, the more we increase complexity of an application

* Key Characteristics
  * Independent Service
  * Loose Coupling **(module data communication)** ***(by public/private api || function call)***
  * Lightweight Technologies
  * Decentralized Data
  * Continuous Delivery

|No| Advantage                          | Disadvantage              |
|--|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|1 | Improved Scalability               | Increased Complexity      |
|2 | Enhanced `agility`                 | Distributed Debugging     |
|3 | Increased Fault Tolerance          | Infrastructure Overhead   |
|4 | Simplified Maintenance             | Network Latency           |
|5 | Flexibility in Technology Choices  | Data Consistency          |

<br/><br/>

## Note

* ⬆️ above all these architectures are used to `design` for stand-alone `main applications` & </br>
  ⬇️ bellow all these architectures are used to `work with` `all other architectures`...

<br/><br/>

## 6. Event Driven

Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that, </br>
focuses on events - significant occurrences or changes within a system - to drive application logic and communication. </br>
Instead of traditional request-response interactions, events trigger actions and updates across different services. </br>

```
* Micro Services architecture must need this Event Driven architecture...
* For certain task we can use this architecture with other architecture also...
* Producer --> Event Broker --> Consumer
* A Consumer can also be a Producer... for event creator after finish his responsible task.
* Event is a pice of the data || object, which contain or carey some information || scenario...
* Button click, Key press, Scrolling all are just events... just a pice of data...
* Event normally be a Serial Request
* Event Broker - is a queue
* The Event Broker is not dependent on the services, but the services are dependent on the Event Broker.
* If service is down then the Event Broker has nothing to do...
* Multiple service need to communicate between each other then we will need Event Driven Architecture
```

* Key Elements
  * Events
  * Event Producers
  * Event Consumers
  * Event Broker

|No| Advantage                  | Disadvantage           |
|--|----------------------------|------------------------|
|1 | Scalability                | Increased Complexity   |
|2 | Resilience                 | Debugging Difficulties |
|3 | Loose Coupling             | Monitoring & Tracing   |
|4 | Real-Time Processing       | Data Consistency       |
|5 | Asynchronous Communication | ... ... ...            |

<br/><br/>

## 7. Cloud Native

Cloud-native architecture refers to a `methodology` for designing & building software app, <br/>
specifically for `deployment & operation` in the **cloud computing environment**. <br/>
This approach focuses on maximizing the `benefits & capabilities` offered by cloud platforms & services. <br/>
**Cloud Native and DevOps are to connected with each other**

* Key Characteristics
  * Micro-service architecture need this.
  * Containers
  * Immutable Infrastructure
  * Agility || Continuous Delivery
  * Observability
  * Declarative APIs

|No| Advantage          | Disadvantage              |
|--|--------------------|---------------------------|
|1 | Scalability        | Increased Complexity      |
|2 | Resilience         | Distributed debugging     |
|3 | Agility            | Infrastructure management |
|4 | Cost-effectiveness | Security considerations   |
|5 | Accessibility      | ... ... ...               |

<br/><br/>

## 8. Serverless

Serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model <br/>
where the cloud provider, not the user, manages the servers that run the user's code. <br/>
This means developers can build & deploy applications without having to worry about setting up, managing, & scaling servers. <br/>

* Key Characteristics
  * No Server Management
  * Pay-per-use
  * Microservice
  * Scalability
  * Stateless
  * Event Driven

|No| Advantage                       | Disadvantage         |
|--|---------------------------------|----------------------|
|1 | Reduced operational overhead    | Vendor lock-in       |
|2 | Improved scalability & agility  | Limited control      |
|3 | Cost-efficiency                 | Debugging complexity |
|4 | Faster development & deployment | Cold start issues:   |
|5 | Simplified maintenance          | ... ... ...          |

* **Suitable For**
  * Applications with unpredictable or variable workloads.
  * Microservices applications.
  * Event-driven applications.
  * Applications requiring rapid development & deployment.

* How to Choose Perfect Architecture?
  * There is no definition for perfect architecture
  * Start with minimum effort and budget
  * Although it is difficult however you can reinvent your architecture upon grow
